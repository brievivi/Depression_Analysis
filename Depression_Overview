Looking at persons affected by depression in Kenya - Predicted primary factors;

#1:Age- Identified which age groups were most affected 

#2:Gained/Saved assets- When looking at depression rates between those who made above and below the median gained asset, 
the depression status of those who were below was a significantly larger number. When doing the same with saved assets, the status of those who were depressed was even
larger, so I interpreted that savings had more affect than income.

#3:Agriculture- The percentage rate between those who made less than the median incoming agriculture vs those who made above is only off by 1%, 
meaning that it does not play as large of a role as the other factors.

#4:Family- The rates of depression with families with with 6< family were moderately more depressed than those with <6 family members.
