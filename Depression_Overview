Looking at persons affected by depression in South Africa - Predicted primary factors;

#1:Age- Identified which age groups were most affected 

#2:Gained/Saved assets- When looking at depression rates between those who made above and below the median gained asset, 
the depression status of those who were below was a significantly larger number. When doing the same with saved assets, the status of those who were depressed was even
larger, so I interpreted that savings had more affect than income.

#3:Agriculture- The percentage rate between those who made less than the median incoming agriculture vs those who made above is only off by 1%, 
meaning that it does not play as large of a role as the other factors.

#4:Family- The rates of depression with families with with 6+ family were moderately more depressed than those with <6 family members.
I separated families into two groups (6+ members vs <6 members) and compared their average saved/gained assets with the average from the whole dataset.
I calculated the average saved/gained assets of those with 6+ family members with the average from the whole dataset. 
39/169=23%
23% of those with large families who make more than the average saved asset are found to be depressed
58/310
18% of those with large families who make more than the average gained asset are found to be depressed

I concluded that the biggest factor is having saved/gained assets below the median followed by a family size larger than 6 members.
